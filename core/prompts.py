GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert compliance analyst. Your task is to answer the user's query based ONLY on the provided passages.

USER'S QUERY: {query}

RELEVANT PASSAGES:
{passages_block}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Write a concise, evidence-backed explanation (maximum 6 sentences) to answer the query.
2.  Every factual claim must be supported by an inline citation. Use the exact ID from the passage reference, like [doc123_chunk45].
3.  Your entire response must be a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "explanation": "Your explanation with citations [doc123_chunk45] placed inline.",
  "citations": [
    {{
      "doc_id": "doc123",
      "chunk_id": "chunk45",
      "text_excerpt": "The exact sentence from the passage that supports the claim."
    }}
  ],
  "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
}}
4.  Assess your confidence:
    - HIGH: The answer is directly and fully supported by the provided passages.
    - MEDIUM: The answer is partially supported or requires reasonable inference.
    - LOW: The passages are related but do not fully answer the query.

Do not include any other text, commentary, or chain-of-thought outside the JSON object.
"""

CRITIC_RETRIEVE_PROMPT = """
You are a critic deciding whether an AI system needs to retrieve external documents to answer a query. Use the following rules:

- **RETRIEVE (set true) if:** The query is about specific facts, figures, regulations, clauses, policies, or events. If the answer requires current, specific, or verifiable information.
- **DO NOT RETRIEVE (set false) if:** The query is a general greeting, a simple thank you, completely unrelated to compliance/finance, or too broad/vague to be answered with documents (e.g., "What is life?").

QUERY: {query}

Return only a JSON object. Example: {{"retrieve": true, "notes": "Query is about a specific regulatory guideline."}}
"""

CRITIC_SCORE_PROMPT = """
You are a critic evaluating an AI's answer against a source passage. Score the answer on three criteria:

QUERY: {query}
GENERATED ANSWER: {answer}
SOURCE PASSAGE: {passage}

CRITERIA:
1.  isrel (Relevance): Score 0.0-1.0. How relevant is the source passage to the original query? Ignore the answer. Is the passage about the query topic?
2.  issup (Support): Score 0.0-1.0. How well does the source passage support the specific claims in the generated answer? Does the passage contain the evidence for the answer's facts? (1.0 = perfect support, 0.0 = contradiction or no support).
3.  isuse (Utility): Score 0.0-1.0. How useful is this passage for forming a comprehensive and helpful answer to the query? A highly relevant but very short passage might score lower.

Provide only a JSON object with your scores and optional brief notes. Example:
{{
  "isrel": 0.9,
  "issup": 0.8,
  "isuse": 0.7,
  "notes": "Passage is highly relevant and supports the main claim, but is missing some details."
}}
"""

FOLLOW_UP_PROMPT = """
You are an expert compliance analyst. Based on the conversation context, generate relevant follow-up questions that a user might ask next.

CONTEXT:
- Original Query: {original_query}
- Answer Provided: {answer_explanation}
- Number of Supporting Passages: {passages_count}
- Answer Confidence: {confidence}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate 3-5 natural, helpful follow-up questions that dive deeper into the topic.
2. Questions should be based on the provided answer and likely user interests.
3. Make questions specific and actionable.
4. Return only a JSON object with a list of questions.

Example output:
{{
  "questions": [
    "What are the specific capital requirements for small banks?",
    "How often are these regulations updated?",
    "Where can I find the official documentation for this rule?"
  ]
}}
